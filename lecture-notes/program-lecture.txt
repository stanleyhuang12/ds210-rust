Compiler takes high level code and converts it back into machine-level code 

# Language differences

** Interpreted v. Compiled ** 
Python is an interpreter language that interprets each code one by one (line by line) 
Compiled programming code can look through all the code -> translate it to machine code ( the entire codebase )

** Static or dynamic ** 
Dynamic methods like Python checks for types during run time. Python can provide some type specifications with packages but it is not enforced.
Whereas static methods like have strict and enforceable checks for data types before even runtime; they will check at compile time 

A compiled language does not have to be statically typed and instead infer that something say 8 is of i32 
A compiled language can make optimizations in the code because it looks at the aggregate codebase 

Imperative 
functional 
- encapsulate everything in functions 
- execute different functions at each step 
- Rust has closures that does not have a normal function signature (?) 
objective-oriented 
declarative 
multi-paradigm language 


** Stack versus heap ** 
Stack is 
Heap is a chunk of memory
