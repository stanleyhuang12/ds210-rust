STRINGS (built-in methods)
    ,parse (convert a string representation into text)

unsigned integers: 
- Positive
- u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 or usize (default on your machine is like 32)
- the number of bits you want to allocate for each number 

0 2^n-1 numbers 
    9 to 255 for u8 
    2^8 = 256 numbers i can represent 0-255 
    nsigned Integer	Unsigned 8 bit binary

0	00000000
1	00000001 
2	00000010
3	00000011

signed integer 
    -128 to 127 = together is 256 values 

Signed Integer	Signed 8 bit binary
    0	00000000
    1	00000001
    2	00000010
    3	00000011
    -1	11111111
    -2	11111110
    -3	11111101
from the left handside we can add by 2^n where n is the place from the rightmost value 

To convert a positive integer to a negative integer: we follow the twos complement procedure 

Step 1: Represent in bits 
00000111 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 

Step 2: Invert the bits 
11111000 

Step 3: Add a 1 to the last bit 
11111001 = this represents - 7 

Step 4: We know the bit representation is negative because it has a leading 1 
To read we can flip all the representations 

    00000110 = 6 
    6 + 1 = 7 
    negate it again so that it is read as -7 


## Character and String Data types

Character: 'c' '<insert emoji>' 

Initially each character were 8 bits (byte) and represented ASCII, some numbers and mathematical symbols, Roman characters, etc...
Later, they use UTF-8 encoding to encode each string 


Strings: "hello"
String slices:
