git has a hash that is 64 hexadecimal (16 possibilities a-f 0-7) which is a cryptographic hash 
it is good guarantees to be unique for that filed. 


git branch: check the branches 
Creating a branch: 

git branch or git branch -a to tell how many branches there are 
git switch -c "new_branch"
git switch "new_branch" if it exists 


To merge back to the origin/main branch: 
git switch "origin/main" # go back to the branch 
git merge "new_branch" 

git push origin main (this pushes to the remote repository)
